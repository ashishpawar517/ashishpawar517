Hi, I’m Aashish Pawar, a final-year IT/IT Management (Computer Science) student at University of Sydney in Australia.

I’m currently seeking a passionate team to join after graduation. While the stability offered by large organizations is certainly appealing, my priority right now lies with taking bold risks—to build something meaningful, continually challenge myself, and leave a lasting impact.

My primary interests currently include Scalable System Architecture, NLP, LLM, LLM agents, but I’m always eager to explore other impactful domains and problems. Previously, I worked as a junior full stack software engineer at Fraser's Medical, an online education firm, where I contributed to developing in-house AI tools to help students prepare for their GAMSAT, UCAT exams.

Feel free to connect with me on  GitHub, or LinkedIn. My resume is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IoO9GzvkfpNMrZDwyylAZ0y147SQ6rm_/view?usp=sharing). If you think I’d be a great fit for your team, please reach out via [email](mailto:emailforashish511.com).
